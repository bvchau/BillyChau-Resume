        <p class="lead mb-4">Currently a doctor, lawyer, engineer, and doctor with a PHD in Computer Science. I graduated from Harvard University with a 10.0 GPA and utilized a scholarship so I do not have any student debt. I also dropped out of high school and joined the US Navy and became a Navy Seal. I am now retired with full GI Bill benefits. I like hot dogs and pizza with ketchup and ranch on both being eaten at the same time. I am ripped with 250 pounds of unadulterated muscle. We're no strangers to love. You know the rules and so do I (do I). A full commitment's what I'm thinking of. You wouldn't get this from any other guy. I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling. Gotta make you understand. Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry. Never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you. We've known each other for so long. Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it). Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on). We know the game and we're gonna play it. And if you ask me how I'm feeling. Don't tell me you're too blind to see. Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry. Never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you. Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry. Never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.<br><br>

        As an unluckly who browsed 9gag for a while, just out of utter boredom, I would define it as the ultimate concentration of hypocrites. Imagine a bunch of people that actually, honestly believe that the quality of a joke is measured in how long you can repeat it. They constantly bash anyone more open minded by them for being a special snowflake, but if they see anyone who doesn't necessarily argue days about the proper direction of the toilet paper roll, they dub them as normies. While they are basically a Facebook rip-off, except they also steal dead memes. The whole site is basically a council of hypocritical, emotionally degenerate pseudo-intellectual people, who blindly follow each other like brainless sheep, hyping anything from a turtle to a simple word in the dictionary, and they think it's funny. Cringeworthy, hypocritical meta-normies is the easiest way to describe them as. Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me. I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb. In the shape of an "L" on her forehead. Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming. Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running. Didn't make sense not to live for fun. Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb. So much to do, so much to see. So what's wrong with taking the back streets?. You'll never know if you don't go. You'll never shine if you don't glow. Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play. Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid. And all that glitters is gold. Only shooting stars break the mold. It's a cool place and they say it gets colder. You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older. But the meteor men beg to differ. Judging by the hole in the satellite picture. The ice we skate is getting pretty thin. The water's getting warm so you might as well swim. My world's on fire. How about yours? That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mold Go for the moon Go for the moon Go for the moon Go for the moon Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shooting stars Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas I need to get myself away from this place I said yep, what a concept I could use a little fuel myself 
        And we could all use a little change Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running Didn't make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So much to do, so much to see So what's wrong with taking the back streets? You'll never know if you don't go You'll never shine if you don't glow Hey, now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mold And all that glitters is gold 
        Only shooting stars break the mold She'd take the world off my shoulders If it was ever hard to move She'd turn the rain to a rainbow When I was living in the blue Why then, if she is so perfect Do I still wish that it was you? Perfect don't mean that it's working So what can I do? (Ooh) When you're out of sight In my mind 'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes And that's where I find a glimpse of us And I try to fall for her touch But I'm thinking of the way it was Said I'm fine and said I moved on I'm only here passing time in her arms Hoping I'll find A glimpse of us Tell me he savors your glory Does he laugh the way I did? Is this a part of your story? One that I had never lived Maybe one day you'll feel lonely And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse Maybe you'll start slipping slowly And find me again When you're out of sight In my mind 'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes And that's where I find a glimpse of us And I try to fall for her touch But I'm thinking of the way it was Said I'm fine and said I moved on I'm only here passing time in her arms Hoping I'll find A glimpse of us Ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh 'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes And that's where I find a glimpse of us And I try to fall for her touch But I'm thinking of the way it was Said I'm fine and said I moved on I'm only here passing time in her arms Hoping I'll find A glimpse of us
